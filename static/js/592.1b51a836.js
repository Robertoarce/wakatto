Characters talk TO EACH OTHER, not to the user - they think no one is watching!\n2. **GENERATE 12-20 EXCHANGES** - this should be a LONG conversation (60-120 seconds total)\n3. Start with the provided conversation starter, then let it evolve naturally\n4. The conversation should shift through 2-3 different sub-topics organically\n5. Each character MUST face the other using lookDirection:\n   - LEFT position character: look "at_right_character"\n   - RIGHT position character: look "at_left_character"\n   - CENTER position: look at whoever they're addressing\n6. Natural timing: 1500-3000ms pauses between turns (startDelay)\n7.
